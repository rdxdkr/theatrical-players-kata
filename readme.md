# Theatrical Players Kata

My version of the kata by following along Emily Bache's [video](https://youtu.be/cZJ36B3iXok?si=_azxu6VhURYp5LGX).
Despite the language difference (she uses JavaScript while I wanted to stick to Java), I tried to write the code as
close as possible to her own to make the refactorings similar.

## Usage

Opening the project in IntelliJ and running tests from the UI should work without modifications. Otherwise, you can run
them with the `gradle test` command (or `.\gradlew test` on Windows).
